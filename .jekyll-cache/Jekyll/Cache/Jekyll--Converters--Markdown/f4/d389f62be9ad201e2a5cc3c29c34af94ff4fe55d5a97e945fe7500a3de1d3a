I"Ë<p>The Electrum Archive is a place where I share bits and pieces of my campaign setting <strong>the Electrum Sea</strong>.</p>

<p>It is where Iâ€™ll just dump ideas that I have bouncing around in my head and want to collect somewhere, instead of them withering away in my notes app.</p>

<p>Most of the ideas here will be written for use with DURF, but since it shares a lot of DNA with other OSR games youâ€™ll probably be able to salvage most of it if you prefer a different system.</p>

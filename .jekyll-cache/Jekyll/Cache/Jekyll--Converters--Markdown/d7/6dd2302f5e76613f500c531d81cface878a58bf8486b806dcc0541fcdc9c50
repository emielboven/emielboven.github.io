I"<p>The Electrum Archive is a place where I share bits and pieces of my campaign setting <strong>the Electrum Sea</strong>.</p>

<p>It is where I’ll just dump ideas that I have bouncing around in my head and want to collect somewhere, instead of them withering away in my notes app.</p>

<p>Most of the ideas here will be written for use with <a href="https://emielboven.itch.io/durf">DURF</a>, but since it shares a lot of DNA with other OSR games you’ll probably be able to salvage most of these writings for use with a different system.</p>

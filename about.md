The Electrum Archive is a place where I share bits and pieces of my campaign setting **the Electrum Sea**. 

It is where I'll just dump ideas that I have bouncing around in my head and want to collect somewhere, instead of them withering away in my notes app.

Most of the ideas here will be written for use with [DURF](https://emielboven.itch.io/durf), but since it shares a lot of DNA with other OSR games you'll probably be able to salvage most of these writings to work with the games you play.

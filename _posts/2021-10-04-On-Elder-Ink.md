title: On Elder Ink
---

The Electrum Sea covers a large swath of the world of Orn. Despite it's name, the Sea is not a large body of water but an expansive desert. The sands that make up it's dunes consist for a large part of electrum particles. Noone knows exactly how the silver and gold alloy became part of the desert sands but its abundance has made the material almost worthless to the inhabitants of the Sea.

On Orn gold is not the coveted substance it is on other worlds. Here, the pauper dreams of a liquid, black as a starless night. The dreams of gods distilled into an oily black ink known as elder ink.

Elder ink is used as the main form of currency in the Electrum Sea. Drops of ink encased in crystal spheres are used for most transactions. Larger sums might be payed using vials or small electrum drums that protect it from evaporating.

The method to create elder ink was lost when the Elders fell from the heavens. Now, new ink only enters the economy when it is found by ink seekers, the desperate people exploring the lost places beneath the dunes hoping to uncover what is left behind by the Elders.

### What makes elder ink so special
The ink is innately magical and can be used in a variety of magical processes:

* **Spellcasting** - The ink can be used to craft spell scrolls and magic users in the Electrum Sea tattoo themselves with it. These tatoos allow them to cast spells without the use of a spell scroll. The designs of these tatoos often resemble the spell's effect. For example, a man with a tatoo of an eye on his forehead might be able to use a spell to see the future.

* **Inkbound Contracts** - Contracts written and signed in elder ink are magically bound and imposible to break.

* **Blackveins** - Some among the ultra rich undergo a risky procedure to become what is known as a blackvein. The procedure involves draining their body of its blood while simultaneously filling it with elder ink. The ink regenerates the blackvein's body, extends their lifespan and amplifies their magical powers. A blackvein's skin becomes a gray caricature of its former color while their lips and the white of their eyes turn black.

## Ink instead of Gold in DURF
For simplicity sake a single in crystal encased ink drop (ID) is roughly the same value as a gold pound (GP) in DURF. So the the same rules apply for gaining HD and buying *Supply* etc.
